Increase of automation and smart components in industry.
Captured as Industry 4.0.
Standard xxx for designs -- application and deployment
Tools such as 4diac or autofocus for developing (compliant)
designs
using graphical interface.
Security study outlines attacks of concern and security
practices.
But little in the way of formal specification and analysis.

In this paper we present a formal framework for specifying
I4.0 applications and analyzing safety and security properties
using the Maude system and environment. 
The development process from application to deployment 
to distributed system is captured by theory transformations
with associated theorems showing that much of the analysis
(safety and security) can be carried out at the abstract
application level.
